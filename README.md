# Sudoku
<h3> Backtracking brute force algorithm
<p>
<p> The algorithm can be used to
<p> >> solve a Sudoku puzzle
<p> >> generate a random Sudoku puzzle
<p> >> verify the solution to a Sudoku puzzle
<p>
<p> The puzzle is defined as a 9x9 2D array
<p> a 9x9x9 3D array is used to save the list of all possible values in every location
<p> the values in this 3D array is generated randomly 
<p> this means the time taken to arrive at a solution cannot be predicted.
<p> elapsed time and the backtraced count are printed after the solution
